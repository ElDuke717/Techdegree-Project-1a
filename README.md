# Techdegree Project 1a
This is where my Treehouse TechDegree First Assigment files are stored.  I'm hopeful that these files and repository work right! 


7-17-20 I started working within the repository again today and it seems to be working OK.  If it doesn't work, then I 'll clone all this text and start a new repository.  It seems that there may be too many nested folders and I just need to be aware of how this is all structured.  
7-16-20 I somehow messed up the first repository when I dragged over the files.  This is a new one starting over. 
Here's a second line of text to test this out again.
